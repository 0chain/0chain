# Contributing to 0Chain
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Actions](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Clone the repo and create your branch from `staging`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. To raise a PR, look for a branch that corresponds to `sprint-$month-$numberOfWeek`. For example, in the fourth week of June, look for the branch `sprint-june-4`. Set this as the target branch of your PR.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Ensure the code owners approve your branch (they might usually have some comments, which you can resolve and ask for a re-review).
7. The PR gets merged, yay!

## Any contributions you make will be under the ZÃœS Copyright
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Non-compete BSD-3-Clause](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/blob/staging/LICENSE.txt) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/issues/new); it's that easy!
