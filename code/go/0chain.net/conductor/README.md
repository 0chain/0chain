# Conductor

Conductor is an RPC server used for integrations tests.
It can control nodes to make them behave badly in the network as required.
As an RPC server, it also receives events from the nodes to reliably manage the test progressions.

The conductor is automated as much as it can be.

## How it works

The conductor requires the nodes to be built on a certain way in order to control them during the tests.
Particularly, when miners and sharders are built, it uses a tag `integration_tests`.
The `go build` will use the go files ending with `_integration_tests.go` instead of `_main.go` files.
The `_integration_tests.go` copy communicates with the conductor through RPC.

During run time, the conductor loads a yaml file for its config and uses a test suite which defines the tests.

### Conductor config

The config file is defined in [conductor.config.yaml](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/blob/master/docker.local/config/conductor.config.yaml)

The important details in the config file are the following.

- details of all nodes used
- custom commands used in tests
- `stuck_warning_threshold` setting to show additional output when the chain is stuck for more than specified duration

### Conductor test suite

The test suite contains multiple sets of tests and each contains multiple test cases.

The individual test cases cannot be run in parallel which is the reason the tests run for hours.

Below is a sample of test suite.

```yaml
# Under `enable` is the list of sets that will be run.
enable:
  - "Miner down/up"
  - "Blobber tests"

# Test sets defines the test cases it covers.
sets:
  - name: "Miner down/up"
    tests:
      - "Miner: 50 (switch to contribute)"
      - "Miner: 100 (switch to share)"
  - name: "Blobber tests"
    tests:
      - "All blobber tests"

# Test cases defines the execution flow for the tests.
tests:
  - name: "Miner: 50 (switch to contribute)"
    flow:
    # Flow is a series of directives.
    # The directive can either be built-in in the conductor
    # or custom command defined in "conductor.config.yaml"
      - set_monitor: "sharder-1" # Most directive refer to node by name, these are defined in `conductor.config.yaml`
      - cleanup_bc: {} # A sample built-in command that triggers stop on all nodes and clean up.
      - start: ['sharder-1']
      - start: ['miner-1', 'miner-2', 'miner-3']
      - wait_phase:
          phase: 'contribute'
      - stop: ['miner-1']
      - start: ['miner-1']
      - wait_view_change:
          timeout: '5m'
          expect_magic_block:
            miners: ['miner-1', 'miner-2', 'miner-3']
            sharders: ['sharder-1']
  - name: "Miner: 100 (switch to share)"
    flow:
    ...
  - name: "All blobber tests"
    flow:
      - command:
          name: 'build_test_blobbers' # Sample custom command that executes `build_test_blobbers`
    ...
...
```

## Category of conductor tests supported

The conductor test suites are configured on yaml files. These test suites can be categorized into 3.

1. `standard tests` - confirms chain continue to function properly despite bad miner and sharder participants
- [conductor.miners.yaml](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/blob/master/docker.local/config/conductor.miners.yaml)
- [conductor.sharders.yaml](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/blob/master/docker.local/config/conductor.sharders.yaml)
2. `view-change tests` - confirms view change (addition and removal of nodes) is working
- [conductor.no-view-change.fault-tolerance.yaml](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/blob/master/docker.local/config/conductor.no-view-change.fault-tolerance.yaml)
- [conductor.view-change.byzantine.yaml](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/blob/master/docker.local/config/conductor.view-change.byzantine.yaml)
- [conductor.view-change.fault-tolerance.yaml](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/blob/master/docker.local/config/conductor.view-change.fault-tolerance.yaml)
3. `blobber tests` - confirms storage functions continue to work despite bad or lost blobber, and confirms expected storage function failures
- [conductor.blobber-1.yaml](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/blob/master/docker.local/config/conductor.blobber-1.yaml)
- [conductor.blobber-2.yaml](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/blob/master/docker.local/config/conductor.blobber-2.yaml)

## Test cases covered

To know about the specific test cases covered by the conductor tests, navigate to the test suite files listed above.

## Required setup

Below are the basic setup required to run the test suites.

1. Git clone [0chain](https://github.com/0chain/0chain)
2. Build miner docker image for integration test

```sh
(cd 0chain && ./docker.local/bin/build.miners-integration-tests.sh)
```

2. Build sharder docker image for integration test

```sh
(cd 0chain && ./docker.local/bin/build.sharders-integration-tests.sh)
```

NOTE: The miner and sharder images are designed for integration tests only. If wanted to run chain normally, rebuild the original images.
  
```sh
(cd 0chain && ./docker.local/bin/build.sharders.sh && ./docker.local/bin/build.miners.sh)
```

3. Confirm that view change rounds are set to 50 on `0chain/docker.local/config/sc.yaml`

```yaml
start_rounds: 50
contribute_rounds: 50
share_rounds: 50
publish_rounds: 50
wait_rounds: 50
```

## Running standards tests

1. Run miners test

```sh
(cd 0chain && ./docker.local/bin/start.conductor.sh miners)
```

2. Run sharders test

```sh
(cd 0chain && ./docker.local/bin/start.conductor.sh sharders)
```

## Running view-change tests

1. Set `view_change: true` on `0chain/docker.local/config/0chain.yaml`
2. Run view-change tests

```sh
(cd 0chain && ./docker.local/bin/start.conductor.sh view-change.fault-tolerance)
(cd 0chain && ./docker.local/bin/start.conductor.sh view-change.byzantine)
(cd 0chain && ./docker.local/bin/start.conductor.sh view-change-3)
```

## Running blobber tests

Blobber tests require more setup.

1. Git clone [blobber](https://github.com/0chain/blobber)
2. Git clone [zboxcli](https://github.com/0chain/zboxcli)
3. Git clone [zwalletcli](https://github.com/0chain/blobber)
4. Git clone [0dns](https://github.com/0chain/0dns)
5. Confirm directories

```
0chain/
blobber/
zboxcli/
zwalletcli/
0dns/
```

6. Install zboxcli

```sh
(cd zboxcli && make install)
```

7. Install zwalletcli

```sh
(cd zwalletcli && make install)
```

8. Patch 0dns

```sh
(cd 0dns && git apply --check ../0chain/docker.local/bin/conductor/0dns-local.patch)
(cd 0dns && git apply ../0chain/docker.local/bin/conductor/0dns-local.patch)
```

9. Patch blobbers

```sh
(cd blobber && git apply --check ../0chain/docker.local/bin/conductor/blobber-tests.patch)
(cd blobber && git apply ../0chain/docker.local/bin/conductor/blobber-tests.patch)
```

10. Add `~/.zcn/config.yaml` as follows

```yaml
block_worker: http://127.0.0.1:9091
signature_scheme: bls0chain
min_submit: 50
min_confirmation: 50
confirmation_chain_length: 3
max_txn_query: 5
query_sleep_time: 5
```

11. Apply if on Ubuntu 18.04

https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/563#issuecomment-547962928

The bug in Ubuntu 18.04 related. It relates to docker-credential-secretservice
package required by docker-compose and used by docker. A docker process
(a build, for example) can sometimes fail due to the bug. Some tests have
internal docker builds and can fail due to this bug.

12. Run blobber tests

```sh
(cd 0chain && ./docker.local/bin/start.conductor.sh blobber-1)
(cd 0chain && ./docker.local/bin/start.conductor.sh blobber-2) (edited)
```

## Updating conductor tests

### Updating the tests

To add more tests, simply create new test cases and add them to existing or new set.
Then be sure to enable the test set if creating a new one.

### Temporarily disabling tests

To test a specific test, simply comment out the other tests on `enable` part of the conductor test yaml.

For example, only run `Miner down/up`

```yaml
enable:
  - "Miner down/up"
#  - "Sharder down/up"
#  - "All miners down/up"
#  - "All sharders down/up"
#  - "All nodes down/up"
```

### Common directive properties

- `timeout` - All commands support a timeout out of the box. Valid values in time duration format (eg. `1s` for 1 second, `10m` for 10 minutes). The default is 2 minutes.
- `must_fail` - Whether the test should fail if the command throw an error. By default, built-in commands have `must_fail` as false. Custom commands however is configurable with`should_fail` when declared.

The list is available on [conductor.config.yaml](https://github.com/0chain/0chain/blob/master/docker.local/config/conductor.config.yaml#L146).

### Adding new command

#### To add a new command that executes a CLI command, simply update `docker.local/config/conductor.config.yaml`

Add a new command under `commands`

```yaml
your_command_name:
  work_dir: "../blobber" # working directory where the command will be called is relative to ./0chain folder
  exec: "../blobber/docker.local/bin/docker-clean.sh" ## CLI command to execute
  can_fail: true #
```

To use, simply provide the `command` directive and the custom command name on test suite.

```yaml
- name: "All blobber tests"
  flow:
    - command:
        name: "your_command_name"
```
