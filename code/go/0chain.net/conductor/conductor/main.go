// Package conductor represents 0chain BC testing conductor that
// maintain BC joining and leaving. It's introduced to test some
// view change cases where a miner comes up and goes down.
//
// The conductor uses RPC to control nodes. It starts and stops
// miners and sharders. It controls their lifecycle and entire
// system state. There is internal BC monitoring to generate
// events depending BC state (view change, view change phase,
// nodes registration, etc).
//
// All the cases uses b0magicBlock_4_miners_1_sharder.json where
// there is 1 genesis sharder and 4 genesis miners. Also, there is
// 2 non-genesis sharders and 1 non-genesis miner.
