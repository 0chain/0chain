# test cases
tests:
  # This test verifies the expected failures on zbox upload and download such as the following.
  # - `zbox upload` without meta
  # - `zbox upload` non-existing file
  # - `zbox upload` without write marker
  # - `zbox download` without locked read tokens
  # - `zbox download` without read marker
  # - Markers out of order
  # - Simulatenous `zbox upload`, `zbox download`, and `zbox delete`
