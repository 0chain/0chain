# Following standard Unix convention, the file librocksdb.x.y is a symbolic link
# to librocksdb.x.y.z. Unfortunately, the Docker COPY command reads through
# symbolic links and copies the file to which they point. Additionally, there is
# no glob syntax to specify that we want to COPY the .x.y file without also
# copying the .x.y.z file. But since librocksdb is 25 MB, we don't want to
# duplicate it.
#
# Above, we copied the .x.y.z file. Now we can manually rename it from .x.y.z
# to .x.y.
